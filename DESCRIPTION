Package: famat
Title: Functional analysis of metabolic and transcriptomic data
Version: 1.5.0
Description:
    Famat is made to collect data about lists of genes and metabolites provided
    by user, and to visualize it through a Shiny app.
    Information collected is:
    - Pathways containing some of the user's genes and metabolites (obtained
    using a pathway enrichment analysis).
    - Direct interactions between user's elements inside pathways.
    - Information about elements (their identifiers and descriptions).
    - Go terms enrichment analysis performed on user's genes.
    The Shiny app is composed of:
    - information about genes, metabolites, and direct interactions between 
    them inside pathways.
    - an heatmap showing which elements from the list are in pathways 
    (pathways are structured in hierarchies).
    - hierarchies of enriched go terms using Molecular Function and 
    Biological Process.
