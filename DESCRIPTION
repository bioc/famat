Title: Functionnal analysis of metabolic and transcriptomic data
Version: 0.99.0
Description: Allow users to perform a pathway enrichment analysis on a list of genes and metabolites, then to visualize and filter results throught a Rshiny interface. Results are an heatmap showing which elements from the list are in some pathways, a GO enrichment analysis using MF and BP, and some informations about genes, metabolites and direct interactions between them inside pathways.
